# Conclusion

To conclude, throughout this project we have been able to gather many insights about the FIFA dataset and get answers to the different questions we asked ourselves at the beginning. 

We were able to analyse the player heights and confirm their normal distribution for both men and women. We also saw that heights were different depending on the player position. Moreover, after performing dimensionality reduction using PCA, we saw that there are certain features that contribute more than others to a player having a better overall score and a higher market value. We then compared men and women salaries and confirmed the great disparities between them, something that must be seriously changed for the development of women football. Lastly, using the highcharter package, we checked where the best players were from and saw that Spain is by far the best country in 2022, followed by Brazil, Argentina and France.

Our study was limited by the fact that this is data from a video game (so not completely accurate) but overall, it did confirm the assumptions that we had prior to starting our analysis of the dataset. It would be amazing to be able to do more analysis of the different versions of the game (compare our results for FIFA15 to FIFA22) rather than solely concentrate ourselves on the latest version of the game. 

This project was extremely insightful as it allowed us to apply the different skills learned in class (data cleaning and transformation), D3 for the interactive component and how to make impactful visualizations.
