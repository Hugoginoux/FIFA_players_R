Football is the most popular sport in the world. There are more than 240 million football players registered to a club and billions of more fans. Every 4 years an international tournament, The World Cup, captivates billions of fans from all countries, making it the most-watched sporting event around the globe. Football fans often try and compare their favorite players and one can easily gather information about their height, weight, salary, goals, etc., however, comparisons between players can become subjective and difficult without an official ranking. 

FIFA, a video game franchise, allows one to simulate football matches (on PS5 and Xbox among others), provides rankings of players and their attributes. The game is released annually by Electronic Arts (EA), with updated players and statistics, is a fan favorite among sports video games. Unsurprisingly, FIFA is the highest-selling sports video game, selling 260 million copies as of 2022 (the next highest is Madden, with over 130 million copies sold).

The amount of data that is contained in one of these games is colossal. For instance, the newest release, FIFA 23, features more than 19,000 players across 700 teams. Each of these players is assigned specific ratings for over 100 attributes, such as speed, strength, mentality, striking, goalkeeping, etc. Moreover, since 2016, the game has included female players and female teams. 

The vast amount of data that is present in one of these games is enough to conduct a variety of compelling analysis and visualizations. The specific ratings given to each player allow us to explore correlations and patterns between variables. A few possible ways to analysis the data (more of this in 2.2) are: seeing how overall rating influences salary, what the height distribution is by position, and how specific playersâ€™ ratings changed over time. 

While specific ratings are not available in the real world of football, using the data from the FIFA video games allows us to analyze players and their skills in a more quantitative, rather than qualitative, way. The tremendous interest in football worldwide makes this a fascinating topic with a plethora of insights to uncover.
